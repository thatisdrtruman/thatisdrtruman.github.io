# And We're Together

Molly introduced me to a new person.
She said, "New friend, Jamie!"

One look at Jamie, and I did not like him. He look fatigued and seem to sweat a lot.

    I said, "He's weird!"

    Molly replied, "He's not! I think we're together!"

And I could not believe that my friend, Molly, preferred Jamie than me.

Then, Jamie spoke: "We've known each other a long time, and we though you knew that."

But I did not say anything and began walking out.

Behind my back, I heard Molly and Jamie speaking, but could not know what.

I turned my head, and I could not avoid their sad faces.

Jamie called out, "I need support!"

I stopped! I walked back! "What?" I exclaimed.

"Can you suggest how we befriend others?"

I felt rotten. I thought that Molly ditched me for Jamie.

"Favourites?" I asked Jamie.

"Hats," he answered, glaring at my baseball cap.

"Me too!" I said, now understanding why Jamie explained that. I showed him my cap, a bit ruffed up, but did the job.

Jamie glared at it, turning it for a few seconds. He gasped, "I never seen such a great hat!"

"If you like it, have it," I offered, realising we now have a common ground.

"Thanks!" Jamie put the cap on his head, the shadow casted on his face. His forehead stopped dripping sweat, and he smiled.

Molly gave the same impression, "I have another hat for you, I know you would like this one better." She passed me a package wrapped in a newspaper.
"Open it," she insisted.

And I did. What was it? A new bucket hat, black as night.

"Oh... wow!" I was stunned.

"Thank you," Jamie rejoiced quietly.

"This hat didn't fit Jamie well, so I thought we'd swap," Molly explained.

"Cool..." I grinned.

From then one, me and Jamie became together.

So that every time someone asked me about Jamie, I only say this: 'We are Together'.

I never seen Jamie without my old cap on since then.
