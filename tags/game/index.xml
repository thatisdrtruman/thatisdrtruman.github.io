      <description>This is the second post to &amp;lsquo;Fillup&amp;rsquo;, to see the first post about it, go here To download the APK, scroll to the bottom, or press here, iOS coming soon I made this app to organise my game better, by allowing players to roll their moves dice and slide their Health Point themselves. So far, only on Android 5.0+, but this proves I am capable of making mobile apps, and web applications.</description>

WIP (Still need texture and animation and bio) Bejin Bot A robot designed in Blender inspired by a robot from an Australian animator.

Still deciding how to colour it, and its purpose in a game, art or story.
Name derived from &amp;lsquo;Begin&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;g&amp;rsquo; soften to &amp;lsquo;j&amp;rsquo;, to reference my first character design in Blender.

I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.
Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.
If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.
If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with &amp;ldquo;I would like a sticky note card.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.
The manual and documentation: https://shorturl.at/kuX29
The game layout: The empty playing board All basic items tokens ready to put in the game: All basic ability tokens ready to put in the game: There are 8 different abilities, each has 4 The healthboard: The player decides behind the wall what they want to do.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
