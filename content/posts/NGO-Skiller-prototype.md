I completed this one night, for an unsuccessful project, which shows the prototype of the project in the case of the volunteer (the user with the lowest file editing rights, i.e. non-admin, temporary)

You can test the prototype by downloading on this website: https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/skiller-UX-UI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

It teaches User Experience, User Interface design and shows concretely the flow and the expected actions for the user, for users to understand the flow and what they expect to see.

Play around the prototype, download the zip file, extract it on your PC, open the volunteer directory, and open 'index.html' and play around.

Aim, try to complete a module.
