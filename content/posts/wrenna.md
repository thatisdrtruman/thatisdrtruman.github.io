This is Wrenna, an acquaintance when I was in a music programme with Wrenna. Effectively, I want to support her with the two reviews of the two songs on Spotify as of 22 October 2024.

My review:
She is inspired by Birdy and a big hint of Olivia Rodrigo. She could be a local star, and potentially be a regional singer.  hope someday she gets to collab or get involved with Lana Del Rey and Olivia Rodrigo.

## These Nights

I never tried listening to others music unless other media plays them.

However, when Wrenna promoted the two songs on Spotify, I already fell enamoured by how much effort she had put in to complete a potentially commerically viable song.

It reminds me of Vampire by Rodrigo, I can tell her inspiration from that. She can sing flatly but with those harmonics in the chorus, they slightly supercede her flats. If this is her first published song, she is getting there. However, this is great enough for modern chilled pop songs. 

I am pleased she has released this and her next song under this review.

## Life in the 20s

One of the slightly less powerful song than These Nights, and more upbeat than These Nights. Reminds me of a more ballad uptone to Lisa Loeb's Miss You. Closely to Taylor Swift too. It explains how life is mixed and 'changing' and can be for good and bad. A nice theme, but be balladful like Christina Perri, especially like 'A Thousand Years'.

Still with her dedication and committment, I'm sure she will be a fantastic singer-songwriter years down the line.

## How can Wrenna improve her potential?
Listening to songs by Lana Del Rey, calm songs by Taylor Swift, and keep writing the right lyrics to fit in the theme well.

If Wrenna wants to go into the calm, chilled music industry, she can continue how she is. If Wrenna wants to take a commercial upbeat pop stance, Sabrina Carpenter would be a great start, putting in soft dums to a beat.

Written 22 October 2024.
