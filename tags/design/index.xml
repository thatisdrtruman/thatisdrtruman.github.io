Still deciding how to colour it, and its purpose in a game, art or story.
Name derived from &amp;lsquo;Begin&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;g&amp;rsquo; soften to &amp;lsquo;j&amp;rsquo;, to reference my first character design in Blender.

I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.
Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.
If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.
If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with &amp;ldquo;I would like a sticky note card.</description>

      <description>A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.
The manual and documentation: https://shorturl.at/kuX29
The game layout: The empty playing board All basic items tokens ready to put in the game: All basic ability tokens ready to put in the game: There are 8 different abilities, each has 4 The healthboard: The player decides behind the wall what they want to do. After the deciding time is up, the wall is removed and the actions take place.</description>

      <title>My designed logo</title>

      <description>Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile&amp;rsquo;s case, the top.
That is my logo.
Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).
Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.
That is how I named my business and my logo. To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity.</description>

      <description>PECSOnline PECSOnline was a software I made for my individual Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Computer Science Degree project.
If you want me to remake it for your use: Direct Contact me via any of my social media accounts (starting your message with:
&amp;ldquo;Subject: Remake PECSOnline&amp;rdquo;)
If you can&amp;rsquo;t see it: https://archive.org/embed/joseph-liu-pecs-online-playthrough
The app was usable on the PC, on phone and tablet, via the internet and a browser app. It had user and child adding/modifying, PECS 1-3 or single symbols and 4-6 or sentence making.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
