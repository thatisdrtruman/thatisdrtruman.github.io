Before I made my blog and portfolio website, I published some art content onto DeviantArt.
Some of my favourite art I published there are:
The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,
Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),
Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>

      <title>Music I Done and Setup</title>

      <description>This is how I set up the microphone before I record my voice.
For voice acting, singing, rapping or speaking.
I made this out of a Samson USB Go Mic and a microphone cover.
I first made this box out of acoustic foam attached to cardboard in February when I first made &amp;lsquo;Inspect&amp;rsquo;. And I bought a pop shield in front of the box to oppress spitting &amp;lsquo;p&amp;rsquo; noise. I done this to minimise background when I sing.</description>

      <title>My designed logo</title>
      <link>https://thatisdrtruman.github.io/posts/my-logo/</link>

      <description>Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile&amp;rsquo;s case, the top.
That is my logo.
Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).
Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.
That is how I named my business and my logo. To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity.</description>

      <description>PECSOnline PECSOnline was a software I made for my individual Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Computer Science Degree project.
If you want me to remake it for your use: Direct Contact me via any of my social media accounts (starting your message with:
&amp;ldquo;Subject: Remake PECSOnline&amp;rdquo;)
If you can&amp;rsquo;t see it: https://archive.org/embed/joseph-liu-pecs-online-playthrough
The app was usable on the PC, on phone and tablet, via the internet and a browser app. It had user and child adding/modifying, PECS 1-3 or single symbols and 4-6 or sentence making.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
