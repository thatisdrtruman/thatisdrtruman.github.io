Show your hand, put it up.


Is it closed?


Bring out your thumb.
Your index.
Middle.
Ring.
Small.


It’s your hand.


What is it?


Stick it on a floor, blow on it.
See it sway.
Your flower.


Put it between your nose and mouth.
A suckling pentapus.


Bring it low. Shiver it.
Your beard.


Stick it high, see it twinkle.
Your star.
Then, close it.
It’s dying. Dimming.


BOOM!
