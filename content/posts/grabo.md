In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.

Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.

> Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. 
This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ). I did this to prove that I can make a game in Unreal Engine so that employers have proof of my skills.
However, there is a game-breaking bug, including, not picking up items and falling through the world if touching a wall. More content would hopefully be added in the future, including fixing these bugs.
