## UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it [here](/posts/fillup-status-app) or on ['Fillup Status App'](/posts/fillup-status-app) page.

A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.

The healthboard:

The player decides behind the wall what they want to do.

After the deciding time is up, the wall is removed and the actions take place.

The player figures are the coin shaped tokens.
Below is how the player moves corresponding to revealing their actions: (Before the action)
