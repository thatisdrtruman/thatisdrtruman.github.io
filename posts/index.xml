      <description>When I go to conferences and events, I should give my business card to people.
Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste unneeded resources on business cards, I publish my card on the homepage and here. I will only print them for business card sweepstakes.

MORE TO COME
I now make your blog and/or portfolio website, like mine.
If you want one, go to the fiverr website or contact me by pressing &amp;lsquo;Contact Me&amp;rsquo; in the header.
I take about 2-3 weeks to make it, starting at US$450, but if that&amp;rsquo;s too expensive, send me a form here, start the message with:
&amp;ndash;Blog/portfolio website discount&amp;ndash;
and you can have a website for cheaper.</description>

or HERE
I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.
Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.
If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.
If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with &amp;ldquo;I would like a sticky note card.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.
The manual and documentation: https://shorturl.at/kuX29
The game layout: The empty playing board All basic items tokens ready to put in the game: All basic ability tokens ready to put in the game: There are 8 different abilities, each has 4 The healthboard: The player decides behind the wall what they want to do.</description>

Before I made my blog and portfolio website, I published some art content onto DeviantArt.
Some of my favourite art I published there are:
The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,
Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),
Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>

      <description>This is how I set up the microphone before I record my voice.
For voice acting, singing, rapping or speaking.
I made this out of a Samson USB Go Mic and a microphone cover.
I first made this box out of acoustic foam attached to cardboard in February when I first made &amp;lsquo;Inspect&amp;rsquo;. And I bought a pop shield in front of the box to oppress spitting &amp;lsquo;p&amp;rsquo; noise. I done this to minimise background when I sing.</description>

      <description>Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile&amp;rsquo;s case, the top.
That is my logo.
Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).
Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.
That is how I named my business and my logo. To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
