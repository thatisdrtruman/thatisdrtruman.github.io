      <description>I have just made a Facebook Page of my creative, media and technological enterprise. It will be where I will upload all my creations, and the progress of them. The page will also have links to try out my some free content, and in the future, how to buy other contents.
Also, my Facebook tag now links to my &amp;lsquo;LJ-Left Creations&amp;rsquo; page.

      <title>My designed logo</title>

      <description>Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile&amp;rsquo;s case, the top.
That is my logo.
Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).
Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.
That is how I named my business and my logo. To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity.</description>
