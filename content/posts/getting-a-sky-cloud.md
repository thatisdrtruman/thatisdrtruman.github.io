We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is not hard to get one.
Let's see.

Oh, there's no cloud.
Just one, blue, sky.
There is nothing to catch.
How sad, we have to wait until tomorrow.

Into bed. Zzzzzzz.

We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is not hard to get one.
Let's see.

Oh, there is some cloud.
Fluffy, white clouds in the sky.
Yippee. We can get some.

Ahhhh… (surprised)

We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is not hard to get one.
Let's see.

Oh, we don't have a jar.
We cannot get a cloud.
How sad, we have to get one.

In our kitchen, stomp stomp stomp.
 open the cupboard, creek.
Oooh, there are some empty jars.
Hooray, now let's go.

We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is not hard to get one.
Let's see.

The clouds, still up there.
Jump, jump, jump.
Oh, we're too small.
Our dream is over!
How can we get a cloud?

Hmmmmm…..

We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is hard to get one.
Let's see.

Oh, let's fly up there.
We will take a plane.
Woohoo… we are smart.


We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is not hard to get one.
Let's see.

There's the plane.
Oh dear, we cannot fly it.
The adults say we crash.
Oh no, who will fly for us?

Uuuugh…

We want a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is not hard to get one.
Let's see.

A pilot is going to fly it.
Yay, let's tell the pilot to get a sky cloud.
Yes?! Yes! We're riding with the pilot.
Get in, start the engine, and zoom up.

We are getting a sky cloud.
They’re only up there.
It is almost ours.
Let's go.

Our plane, flies up.
Higher, higher, higher.
We, happy, happier, happier.
Around the cloud, above it.
Open the jar, scoop the cloud.
Close it. See the cloud sparkle in the sky.
… beautiful, awesome.

We have a sky cloud.
It's in our jar.
The best day of our lives.
Let's land on the cloud, pilot.

No!
What?!

The pilot chuckles, we cannot. The sky cloud is just water.
I'll show you. The plane drops closer to the cloud, lower and lower and lower. 
We just see white. And got moist.
And, we pop out from the bottom.
We didn't land?! Nope!

Oh…. 
Now I see!
We land on the ground.

We have a sky cloud.
It's in our jar.
The best day of our lives.
And we know.

Sky Cloud is just water, nothing else.
Let's not get another one again.
