How I decided to make it One day on Tiktok, I came across a Tokyo Disneyland Glu Glu Quacking Stick for the theme park&amp;rsquo;s Quacky City event, celebrating Donald Duck&amp;rsquo;s 90th anniversary.
For a while, I wanted to make a game or an app on Godot and with C#, and I decided to prove myself I can code in C#, with an app version of the Stick.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
