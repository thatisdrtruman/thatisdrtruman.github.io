### To download the APK, scroll to the bottom, or press [here](#download), iOS coming soon
I made this app to organise my game better, by allowing players to roll their moves dice and slide their Health Point themselves.
So far, only on Android 5.0+, but this proves I am capable of making mobile apps, and web applications.
I had help with Java and some YouTube tutorials, but we all have to start somewhere.

### The HP bar (the number changes as you use the slider)

### The moves dice (generates a random number from 1-3, to show the number of moves you have for that turn.)

## Download
[Enjoy!](/fillup-status.apk)
