## PECSOnline



It was a software I made for my individual Bachelor's project for my Computer Science Degree.

The app was usable on the PC, on phone and tablet, via the internet and a browser app. It had user and child adding/modifying, PECS 1-3 or single symbols and 4-6 or sentence making.

It was made up of 9 categories, including one personalised items category.

It also had First this, then that, which was placing symbols on the First and Then backgrounds.

It had personalised items that anyone can upload with an image or in the phone or tablet's case, make from a photo. That personalised item was then either released to everyone on the network of users, or just the personalised item's creator.

It also had a list of a child's personalised items, which the user can modify, providing they put in the right passcode. There, the adult could inactivate all of the child's personalised item or reactivate them. They could also deactivate/reactivate accounts, including in the case of reactivating, put in the old adult user's passcode to reactivate.

I wrote in HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the mobile symbols and PHP to get all of the symbols, child and adult users data and store in the database.

After watching the video, the client, Becky Stephens and her participants, completed the survey on the impact of the features in PECSOnline and how would they improve.

After concluding that the app was extremely beneficial, my project officer, Fernando Loizedes, published my app onto INTERACT2023, a biennial international conference reflecting on technology, as a poster.

I was amazed that the conference has in fact approved my app as a poster at the presentation. So, on the 1st September, INTERACT2023's final day, I presented the poster and my work to lots of attendees, who really appreciated my work.

We also made the paper with the poster: [READ HERE](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/162103/1/PECSOnline__A_Bespoke_Classroom_Based_Picture_Exchange_Communication_System__PECS__for_Children_with_Autism.pdf)
