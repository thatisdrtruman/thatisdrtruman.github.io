      <description>ASK-EHR Throughout March 1-2 2025, I was in a team of 12 to create a streamlined search directory with AI chatbot features.
Nikunj created the idea, then attracted us into the project.
Then, he split the team into story use cases, backend coding, frontend coding and testing and presentation. I was assigned as vice manager, checking the progress of the programme and the presentation.
In the end, we made a working prototype, that I taught them all HuggingFace and a London person taught me Streamlit, and this was the results.</description>

      <description>Play Pythagorised Scoreup! This is my game, Pythagorised Scoreup, built with Pygame and running in your browser thanks to Pygbag!
Choose 10 cards for the base, then another 10 for the height.
Your final score is the square root of the &amp;lsquo;square of the hypotenuse equalling to the sums of the squares on the other two sides&amp;rsquo;.
E.g. Base score is 3, Height score is 4, Hypotenuse and your score is 5 (√(3² + 4² = 25))</description>

      <description>I am tired but I cannot sleep. I just worked a lot before I sleep.
But I cannot stop thinking. I close my right eye but keep the other open.
I need to complete more. It is hard and I do not want to.
But it is needed.
I feel like finishing it now.
To stay up for a very long time, best feeling, worst feeling, determination and doubt.</description>

      <description>This is Wrenna, an acquaintance when I was in a music programme with Wrenna. Effectively, I want to support her with the two reviews of the two songs on Spotify as of 22 October 2024.
My review: She is inspired by Birdy and a big hint of Olivia Rodrigo. She could be a local star, and potentially be a regional singer. hope someday she gets to collab or get involved with Lana Del Rey and Olivia Rodrigo.</description>

      <description>Leaving It Once upon a time, you were able to do something.
Or you wanted to do that something.
But then you needed to do something else, and you leave it for another time.
And it laid in your head of your desire for a while.
When you finished that something else, another something else needs to be done, and your first would need to be ignored.
It went around and around for years, and you may matured.</description>

Oh, there&amp;rsquo;s no cloud. Just one, blue, sky. There is nothing to catch. How sad, we have to wait until tomorrow.
Into bed. Zzzzzzz.

      <description>Show your hand, put it up.
Is it closed?
Bring out your thumb. Your index. Middle. Ring. Small.
It’s your hand.
What is it?
Stick it on a floor, blow on it. See it sway. Your flower.
Put it between your nose and mouth. A suckling pentapus.
Bring it low. Shiver it. Your beard.
Stick it high, see it twinkle. Your star. Then, close it. It’s dying. Dimming.
BOOM!</description>

      <description>The tea once upon a time travelled all the way from tropical places where it grew. The tea only grew when it was at the sun, and the damp, sweaty humidity. One day, a person came to the tea leaf and plucked it off. Where would it go?
The caretaker tossed it into the box, and then the crane pulled it into the boat. And the boat sailed to the destination.</description>

      <description>Minded Minded, not everyone thinks like you.
They all have different mindset to you.
The things you think, the things you do, everyone is not the same.
The life needs you to stick with each other, and combine yours with theirs.
One is not two, one is OK, but two on one brings you on.
Two, to more, to the different mindsets you had not thought of before.
One mind, is dull, no one thinks like you.</description>

      <description>And We&amp;rsquo;re Together Molly introduced me to a new person. She said, &amp;ldquo;New friend, Jamie!&amp;rdquo;
One look at Jamie, and I did not like him. He look fatigued and seem to sweat a lot.
I said, &amp;quot;He&#39;s weird!&amp;quot; Molly replied, &amp;quot;He&#39;s not! I think we&#39;re together!&amp;quot; And I could not believe that my friend, Molly, preferred Jamie than me.
Then, Jamie spoke: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve known each other a long time, and we though you knew that.</description>

I completed this one night, for an unsuccessful project, which shows the prototype of the project in the case of the volunteer (the user with the lowest file editing rights, i.e. non-admin, temporary)
You can test the prototype by downloading on this website: https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/skiller-UX-UI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
It teaches User Experience, User Interface design and shows concretely the flow and the expected actions for the user, for users to understand the flow and what they expect to see.</description>

How I decided to make it One day on Tiktok, I came across a Tokyo Disneyland Glu Glu Quacking Stick for the theme park&amp;rsquo;s Quacky City event, celebrating Donald Duck&amp;rsquo;s 90th anniversary.
For a while, I wanted to make a game or an app on Godot and with C#, and I decided to prove myself I can code in C#, with an app version of the Stick.</description>

      <description>🎶🎶
A song I made in Feb-Mar 2023 for a geeky contest. Original, and I started getting better at music production, with equalizing, producing and songwriting and vocal.

MORE TO COME
I now make your blog and/or portfolio website, like mine.
If you want one, go to the fiverr website or contact me by pressing &amp;lsquo;Contact Me&amp;rsquo; in the header.
I take about 2-3 weeks to make it, starting at US$450, but if that&amp;rsquo;s too expensive, send me a form here, start the message with:
&amp;ndash;Blog/portfolio website discount&amp;ndash;
and you can have a website for cheaper.</description>

Sticky Note Cards and Game or HERE
I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.
Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.
If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.
If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with &amp;ldquo;I would like a sticky note card.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.

Some of my favourite art I published there are:
The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,
Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),
Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>

      <description>This is how I set up the microphone before I record my voice.
For voice acting, singing, rapping or speaking.
I made this out of a Samson USB Go Mic and a microphone cover.
I first made this box out of acoustic foam attached to cardboard in February when I first made &amp;lsquo;Inspect&amp;rsquo;. And I bought a pop shield in front of the box to oppress spitting &amp;lsquo;p&amp;rsquo; noise. I done this to minimise background when I sing.</description>

      <description>Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile&amp;rsquo;s case, the top.
That is my logo.
Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).
Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.
That is how I named my business and my logo. To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
