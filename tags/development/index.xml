MORE TO COME
I now make your blog and/or portfolio website, like mine.
If you want one, go to the fiverr website or contact me by pressing &amp;lsquo;Contact Me&amp;rsquo; in the header.
I take about 2-3 weeks to make it, starting at US$450, but if that&amp;rsquo;s too expensive, send me a form here, start the message with:
&amp;ndash;Blog/portfolio website discount&amp;ndash;
and you can have a website for cheaper.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.
The manual and documentation: https://shorturl.at/kuX29
The game layout: The empty playing board All basic items tokens ready to put in the game: All basic ability tokens ready to put in the game: There are 8 different abilities, each has 4 The healthboard: The player decides behind the wall what they want to do.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
