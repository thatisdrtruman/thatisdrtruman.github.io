I am tired but I cannot sleep.
I just worked a lot before I sleep.

But I cannot stop thinking.
I close my right eye but keep the other open.

I need to complete more.
 It is hard and I do not want to.

But it is needed.

I feel like finishing it now.

To stay up for a very long time, best feeling, worst feeling, determination and doubt.

I am half tired, finishing the work but need to finish.
Close my left eye, open my right.

Others need it very soon, so I can not. When it is good, I can sleep.

Writing, and working and reporting, needed all for the good quality.

Now when it is done. I can rest, fully deserve it and will be of many times.

Ahhh good. left eye close, right eye close.
