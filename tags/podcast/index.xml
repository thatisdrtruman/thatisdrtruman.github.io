      <description>This is how I set up the microphone before I record my voice.
For voice acting, singing, rapping or speaking.
I made this out of a Samson USB Go Mic and a microphone cover.
I first made this box out of acoustic foam attached to cardboard in February when I first made &amp;lsquo;Inspect&amp;rsquo;. And I bought a pop shield in front of the box to oppress spitting &amp;lsquo;p&amp;rsquo; noise. I done this to minimise background when I sing.</description>
