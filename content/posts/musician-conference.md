I had finished a conference to help musician get into the music industry.

i had learnt a lot from the creative side of completing the songs. just do it as they say.

you lose nothing if you try so please do it.

this will help us get somewhere. for me, it will allow me to get my music career to a start.

i had already made a couple of original songs and pt them on my Bandcamp, so if you can support me, please donate or buy a song from my Bandcamp.

there would be people you want to have but also less flashy and less recognisable people working behind the scene that allowed them to be successful.

for one, I met someone who improve musicians' accessibility and say work on the music, and when you are ready to publish, ask people or self-publish them


try go to more networking events relevant to what you do and you can learn all the tips to get into it.

for me, work on the project, ask people for help like feedback and then publish them. all done.

also I helped buy cheaper snacks but very good snacks, the carrots i bought with the hummus went well, with all the carrots and hummus gone after i sliced the carrots into sticks

Now I learnt hoe to write a bid, thinking of all the things they can have and how much money is needed for the thing to be successful.

even with all the setbacks, such as team member and speakers pulling out and removing the stalls from the conference and changing what was initially a ticketed conference, later becoming just turn up, and only about 37 came, it was helpful to see us adapting to difficult scenarios.

Would I make a event like this again? Yes.

Can I make efficient bids? Sure. This will help me financially and my future teams as well.

in summary, work on your passion and ask for help when you require them.

plan well when making a bid and you can be successful at it.
