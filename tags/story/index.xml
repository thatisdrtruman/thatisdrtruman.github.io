      <description>Show your hand, put it up.
Is it closed?
Bring out your thumb. Your index. Middle. Ring. Small.
It’s your hand.
What is it?
Stick it on a floor, blow on it. See it sway. Your flower.
Put it between your nose and mouth. A suckling pentapus.
Bring it low. Shiver it. Your beard.
Stick it high, see it twinkle. Your star. Then, close it. It’s dying. Dimming.
BOOM!</description>

      <description>The tea once upon a time travelled all the way from tropical places where it grew. The tea only grew when it was at the sun, and the damp, sweaty humidity. One day, a person came to the tea leaf and plucked it off. Where would it go?
The caretaker tossed it into the box, and then the crane pulled it into the boat. And the boat sailed to the destination.</description>

      <description>Minded Minded, not everyone thinks like you.
They all have different mindset to you.
The things you think, the things you do, everyone is not the same.
The life needs you to stick with each other, and combine yours with theirs.
One is not two, one is OK, but two on one brings you on.
Two, to more, to the different mindsets you had not thought of before.
One mind, is dull, no one thinks like you.</description>

      <description>And We&amp;rsquo;re Together Molly introduced me to a new person. She said, &amp;ldquo;New friend, Jamie!&amp;rdquo;
One look at Jamie, and I did not like him. He look fatigued and seem to sweat a lot.
I said, &amp;quot;He&#39;s weird!&amp;quot; Molly replied, &amp;quot;He&#39;s not! I think we&#39;re together!&amp;quot; And I could not believe that my friend, Molly, preferred Jamie than me.
Then, Jamie spoke: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve known each other a long time, and we though you knew that.</description>

      <description>My first poem under the psuedonym and main character in a story series: Mitcham Gross My heart is a soul I cannot live without.
My brain is an organ I cannot do without.
My heart is why I am here today.
My brain is why I am feeling today.
My heart is the love where I feel with someone else.
My brain is the computer to think about someone else.</description>

      <description>https://www.deviantart.com/heisdrtruman
Before I made my blog and portfolio website, I published some art content onto DeviantArt.
Some of my favourite art I published there are:
The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,
Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),
Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>
