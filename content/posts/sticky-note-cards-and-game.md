I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.

Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.

If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.

If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with "I would like a sticky note card."
