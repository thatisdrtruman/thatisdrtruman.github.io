      <description>ASK-EHR Throughout March 1-2 2025, I was in a team of 12 to create a streamlined search directory with AI chatbot features.
Nikunj created the idea, then attracted us into the project.
Then, he split the team into story use cases, backend coding, frontend coding and testing and presentation. I was assigned as vice manager, checking the progress of the programme and the presentation.
In the end, we made a working prototype, that I taught them all HuggingFace and a London person taught me Streamlit, and this was the results.</description>

      <description>Play Pythagorised Scoreup! This is my game, Pythagorised Scoreup, built with Pygame and running in your browser thanks to Pygbag!
Choose 10 cards for the base, then another 10 for the height.
Your final score is the square root of the &amp;lsquo;square of the hypotenuse equalling to the sums of the squares on the other two sides&amp;rsquo;.
E.g. Base score is 3, Height score is 4, Hypotenuse and your score is 5 (âˆš(3Â² + 4Â² = 25))</description>

      <description>https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/skiller-UX-UI
I completed this one night, for an unsuccessful project, which shows the prototype of the project in the case of the volunteer (the user with the lowest file editing rights, i.e. non-admin, temporary)
You can test the prototype by downloading on this website: https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/skiller-UX-UI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
It teaches User Experience, User Interface design and shows concretely the flow and the expected actions for the user, for users to understand the flow and what they expect to see.</description>

You can also see how I made &amp;lsquo;Shake To Quack&amp;rsquo; with Godot 3.5.3 with C# Support.
https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/shake-to-quack
How I decided to make it One day on Tiktok, I came across a Tokyo Disneyland Glu Glu Quacking Stick for the theme park&amp;rsquo;s Quacky City event, celebrating Donald Duck&amp;rsquo;s 90th anniversary.
For a while, I wanted to make a game or an app on Godot and with C#, and I decided to prove myself I can code in C#, with an app version of the Stick.</description>

Use Crisp to do it. Thanks Hugo Addon page. However, just a nice feature, but I probably won&amp;rsquo;t reply as much as my social media.
