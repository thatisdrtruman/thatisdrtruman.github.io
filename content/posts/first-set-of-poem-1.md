# Hurt

Touch something, it hurts!

Your hand hurts!

Your head hurts!

Your feelings hurt!

You are hurt!

# Ambition for Youngsters

What do you want to be?

Uhhhhh....  uhhhhh....
I don't know....

A doctor?

I guess so....

Why?

Something to do....

Can you work hard?

Maybe... 

What do you want?

I want to sleep...

Is that it?

Yeah...

Hmmmm...

# Beat to the Day

Beat to, beat to, beat to the day.

The day, the day, the day and they.

What are you waiting for?
Tomowrrow, or another day?

Beat to the day, you will feel better.

Lee says to 'wrap up!'

Naomi says to pack it up?

They could know the idioms to that and many more.

I could find it confusing, unless it is literal.
