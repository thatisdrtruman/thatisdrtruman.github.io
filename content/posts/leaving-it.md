# Leaving It

Once upon a time, you were able to do something.

Or you wanted to do that something.

But then you needed to do something else, and you leave it for another time.

And it laid in your head of your desire for a while.

When you finished that something else, another something else needs to be done, and your first would need to be ignored.

It went around and around for years, and you may matured. 

But that business meant you missed that something and you would never be able to do it at all.

You may have lost all chances of doing it, and that would plague your mind.

Ever after!

Advice: do them now, and do that well.
