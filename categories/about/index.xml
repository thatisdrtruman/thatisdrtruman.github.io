Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>

My dreams are to be a novelist of a unique series, developer/designer of various projects, singer-musician, actor and podcaster.
I have a blog on all my works and my portfolio here.
Notable works:
Two original songs (&amp;lsquo;Your Heroes Inside&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Inspect&amp;rsquo;) and accompanying music videos, as the sole director, producer, editor, composer, and singer-songwriter on TikTok, soon to be on YouTube.</description>
