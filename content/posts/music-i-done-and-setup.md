This is how I set up the microphone before I record my voice.

For voice acting, singing, rapping or speaking.

I made this out of a Samson USB Go Mic and a microphone cover.

I first made this box out of acoustic foam attached to cardboard in February when I first made 'Inspect'. And I bought a pop shield in front of the box to oppress spitting 'p' noise. I done this to minimise background when I sing.

After being dissatisfied with how 'Your Heroes Inside' went, with background noises, unharmonious instruments, I had improved by learning equalising, reverbs and other music production fundamentals.

Such as using Cakewalk (free), with VST, VST3 and vocal supports.

I think it worked, and I will use it when I make vocal based things.

Go to Tiktok or YouTube to find out several cases of my work using the box.
