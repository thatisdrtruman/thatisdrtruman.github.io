      <description>Play Pythagorised Scoreup! This is my game, Pythagorised Scoreup, built with Pygame and running in your browser thanks to Pygbag!
Choose 10 cards for the base, then another 10 for the height.
Your final score is the square root of the &amp;lsquo;square of the hypotenuse equalling to the sums of the squares on the other two sides&amp;rsquo;.
You can also visit the game directly here.</description>

      <description>I made a bot that suggested 5 holidays, with the method of travel, date, and price. It was originally hosted on freeaikit , but with its closure, I put it in this blog.
Copy this on your favourite AI Chatbot.
Please suggest me 5 holidays from [Insert departing place] to [Insert Destination]. Ensure you provide what is the travel method, date of travel and the duration of the holiday and the travel agent and provider of the holiday and the price per person in Pound Sterling and US Dollars, and the link to the holiday.</description>
