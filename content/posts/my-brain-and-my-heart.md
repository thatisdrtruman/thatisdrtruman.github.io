## My first poem under the psuedonym and main character in a story series: Mitcham Gross

My heart is a soul I cannot live without.

My brain is an organ I cannot do without.

My heart is why I am here today.

My brain is why I am feeling today.

My heart is the love where  I feel with someone else.

My brain is the computer to think about someone else.

My heart is the rhythm to move my limbs.

My brain is the rhythm to tell my limbs.

My heart cannot survive my brain.

My brain cannot survive my heart.

If you do not live with both, HOW ARE YOU?!
