      <description>This is the second post to &amp;lsquo;Fillup&amp;rsquo;, to see the first post about it, go here To download the APK, scroll to the bottom, or press here, iOS coming soon I made this app to organise my game better, by allowing players to roll their moves dice and slide their Health Point themselves. So far, only on Android 5.0+, but this proves I am capable of making mobile apps, and web applications.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.
The manual and documentation: https://shorturl.at/kuX29
The game layout: The empty playing board All basic items tokens ready to put in the game: All basic ability tokens ready to put in the game: There are 8 different abilities, each has 4 The healthboard: The player decides behind the wall what they want to do.</description>
