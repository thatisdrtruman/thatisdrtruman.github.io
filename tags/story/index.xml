      <description>And We&amp;rsquo;re Together Molly introduced me to a new person. She said, &amp;ldquo;New friend, Jamie!&amp;rdquo;
One look at Jamie, and I did not like him. He look fatigued and seem to sweat a lot.
I said, &amp;quot;He&#39;s weird!&amp;quot; Molly replied, &amp;quot;He&#39;s not! I think we&#39;re together!&amp;quot; And I could not believe that my friend, Molly, preferred Jamie than me.
Then, Jamie spoke: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve known each other a long time, and we though you knew that.</description>

      <description>My first poem under the psuedonym and main character in a story series: Mitcham Gross My heart is a soul I cannot live without.
My brain is an organ I cannot do without.
My heart is why I am here today.
My brain is why I am feeling today.
My heart is the love where I feel with someone else.
My brain is the computer to think about someone else.</description>

The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,
Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),
Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>
