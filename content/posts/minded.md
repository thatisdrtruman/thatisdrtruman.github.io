# Minded

Minded, not everyone thinks like you.

They all have different mindset to you.

The things you think, the things you do, everyone is not the same.

The life needs you to stick with each other, and combine yours with theirs.

One is not two, one is OK, but two on one brings you on.

Two, to more, to the different mindsets you had not thought of before.

One mind, is dull, no one thinks like you.
Two minds, are better, you at least understand the other.
Three minds, improving. And as soon others share you their minds, you will understand.

How much do you think you are by yourself? A lot? A few? None? 

Only if you are minded and mindful of others, that that 'think' will be a lot.

And you are minded now, and you can be more, if you get more minds.

Mind: it is everyone's bliss.
