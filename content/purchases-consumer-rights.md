Your consumer rights:

I'd like you to read Martin Lewis' MoneySavingExpert about your consumer rights:

[Find it here](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/consumer-rights-refunds-exchange/#goods)

In summary:

Whenever I sell you a product, a digital product or a service, they have to be of satisfactory quality as described,

fit for purpose and last a reasonable time.

You have 14 days after receiving your product to state your intention to return the product, then another 14 days to return that product.

Also, after enquiring about one of my products, you will be given photos/videos of that specific product to fit the 'as described' quality.

All other descriptions apply.
