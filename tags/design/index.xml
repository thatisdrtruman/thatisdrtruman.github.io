      <description>ASK-EHR Throughout March 1-2 2025, I was in a team of 12 to create a streamlined search directory with AI chatbot features.
Nikunj created the idea, then attracted us into the project.
Then, he split the team into story use cases, backend coding, frontend coding and testing and presentation. I was assigned as vice manager, checking the progress of the programme and the presentation.
In the end, we made a working prototype, that I taught them all HuggingFace and a London person taught me Streamlit, and this was the results.</description>

      <description>Play Pythagorised Scoreup! This is my game, Pythagorised Scoreup, built with Pygame and running in your browser thanks to Pygbag!
Choose 10 cards for the base, then another 10 for the height.
Your final score is the square root of the &amp;lsquo;square of the hypotenuse equalling to the sums of the squares on the other two sides&amp;rsquo;.
E.g. Base score is 3, Height score is 4, Hypotenuse and your score is 5 (âˆš(3Â² + 4Â² = 25))</description>

      <description>https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/skiller-UX-UI
I completed this one night, for an unsuccessful project, which shows the prototype of the project in the case of the volunteer (the user with the lowest file editing rights, i.e. non-admin, temporary)
You can test the prototype by downloading on this website: https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/skiller-UX-UI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
It teaches User Experience, User Interface design and shows concretely the flow and the expected actions for the user, for users to understand the flow and what they expect to see.</description>

How I decided to make it One day on Tiktok, I came across a Tokyo Disneyland Glu Glu Quacking Stick for the theme park&amp;rsquo;s Quacky City event, celebrating Donald Duck&amp;rsquo;s 90th anniversary.
For a while, I wanted to make a game or an app on Godot and with C#, and I decided to prove myself I can code in C#, with an app version of the Stick.</description>

Sticky Note Cards and Game or HERE
I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.
Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.
If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.
If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with &amp;ldquo;I would like a sticky note card.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.

      <description>Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile&amp;rsquo;s case, the top.
That is my logo.
Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).
Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.
That is how I named my business and my logo. To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity.</description>

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
