      <description>I have just made a Facebook Page of my creative, media and technological enterprise. It will be where I will upload all my creations, and the progress of them. The page will also have links to try out my some free content, and in the future, how to buy other contents.
Also, my Facebook tag now links to my &amp;lsquo;LJ-Left Creations&amp;rsquo; page.

Before I made my blog and portfolio website, I published some art content onto DeviantArt.
Some of my favourite art I published there are:
The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,
Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),
Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.</description>

      <description>I am a person with autism but that does not mean I am incapable of living a great and fulfilling life!
CV (working as of 18 December 2023): https://t.ly/aQKjU
CV (tech relevant only): https://t.ly/xYDYr
My dreams are to be a novelist of a unique series, developer/designer of various projects, singer-musician, actor and podcaster.
I have a blog on all my works and my portfolio here.
Notable works:
Two original songs (&amp;lsquo;Your Heroes Inside&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Inspect&amp;rsquo;) and accompanying music videos, as the sole director, producer, editor, composer, and singer-songwriter on TikTok, soon to be on YouTube.</description>
