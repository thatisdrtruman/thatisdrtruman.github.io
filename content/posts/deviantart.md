Before I made my blog and portfolio website, I published some art content onto DeviantArt.

Some of my favourite art I published there are:

The Sunset Soldier painted figure for a Warhammer figurine painting competition,

Frisbee Time (I splat paint on a square canvas and flung it around like a frisbee),

Areal Figure (2018, where the area of the red circle matched the area of the green, yellow and blue shapes.)

I do not think I will update my DeviantArt account anymore, but please visit it and enjoy some of my creative arts.
