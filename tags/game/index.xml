      <description>Play Pythagorised Scoreup! This is my game, Pythagorised Scoreup, built with Pygame and running in your browser thanks to Pygbag!
Choose 10 cards for the base, then another 10 for the height.
Your final score is the square root of the &amp;lsquo;square of the hypotenuse equalling to the sums of the squares on the other two sides&amp;rsquo;.
You can also visit the game directly here.</description>

You can also see how I made &amp;lsquo;Shake To Quack&amp;rsquo; with Godot 3.5.3 with C# Support.
https://github.com/thatisdrtruman/shake-to-quack
How I decided to make it One day on Tiktok, I came across a Tokyo Disneyland Glu Glu Quacking Stick for the theme park&amp;rsquo;s Quacky City event, celebrating Donald Duck&amp;rsquo;s 90th anniversary.
For a while, I wanted to make a game or an app on Godot and with C#, and I decided to prove myself I can code in C#, with an app version of the Stick.</description>

Still deciding how to colour it, and its purpose in a game, art or story.

Sticky Note Cards and Game or HERE
I always believe regardless of price, something homemade or unbought always has some soul, a priceless item.
Simple to make: make an art with sticky notes and bookmarks, write your message or picture, and cover it with lots of redundant sticky notes for a game.
If you remove the redundant notes correctly, you will get the right picture and message.
If you would like a personalised card in this style, DM me on Linkedin, Facebook, or Tiktok, starting the message with &amp;ldquo;I would like a sticky note card.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 22 Jan 2024: After playing the game with some people and reviewing how to be more organised, I have made a Fillup Status app for players to track their HP and roll the dice themselves for the number of moves. Download it here or on &amp;lsquo;Fillup Status App&amp;rsquo; page. A game I made in July to January 2023-24, now in its testing phase.

      <description>In July/August 2023, I worked on a My First Game Jam project called Grabo.
Inspired by Kingdom Hearts III using Unreal Engine 4, I wanted to make an Unreal Engine 5 Game as a general 2D platformer.
Grabo, a beartrap in a 2D platformer who needs to destroy all melty liquid vats. This is written in Unreal Engine 5.2.1 as a 2023 My First Game Jam entry ( https://itch.io/jam/my-first-game-jam-summer-2023 ).</description>
