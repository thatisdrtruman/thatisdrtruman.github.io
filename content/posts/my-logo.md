Look at the logo in the top left, or in the mobile's case, the top.

That is my logo.

Being an Asian person, my name would be Liu Zu (Zu became Joe, which is formally Joseph).

Swap over the positions of my western name, reading right to left, like Modern Arabic and ancient Chinese.

## That is how I named my business and my logo.

To conclude, the name and the logo reflects my cultural upbringing with at-time-of-writing modern attractiveness and simplicity. In the future, I will theme my office and work environment around this, until I decided to rebrand.

## UPDATE Christmas Eve 2023:

The logo is added as a favicon.
