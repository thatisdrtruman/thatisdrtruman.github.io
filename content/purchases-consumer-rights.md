Your consumer rights:

I'd like you to read Martin Lewis' MoneySavingExpert about your consumer rights:

[Find it here](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/consumer-rights-refunds-exchange/#goods)

In summary:

Whenever I sell you a product, a digital product or a service, they have to be of satisfactory quality as described, fit for purpose and last a reasonable time.

To receive a full refund:

You have 14 days after receiving your product to state your intention to return the product, then another 14 days to return that product.

Note: you, as the buyer, will have to pay for the return in order to get the refund. Also, my shop is powered by Paypal, which takes a variable fee, depending on where you buy my product.

Also, if you enquire about one of my products, and/or their prices, you will be given photos/videos of that specific product to fit the 'as described' quality. If I accept that price, you will get a contract that you will pay me that amount for your purchases, in the chosen amount of time. After signing and send me the contract, you will get the invoice and the product.


All other descriptions apply.
